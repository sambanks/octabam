# OCTAMAX

**An educational toolkit for understanding how the firmware of the Elektron
Octatrack works.**

OCTAMAX is a reverse-engineering workspace built to *study* the Octatrack MKII
operating system: how the update files are packed, how the code is laid out in
memory, how the microkernel schedules tasks, how the sequencer drives the audio
DSP — and, as a hands-on way of proving that understanding, how a few small,
optional, entirely reversible behavior changes can be added to the OS image.

Everything here is for **educational purposes only**. No Elektron binary is
redistributed. You bring your own copy of the official OS; the tools analyze it
and, if you ask them to, produce a modified image byte-for-byte reproducibly from
that copy.

## Motivation

> Hi, I'm **Maxolydian**, an electronic artist based in Palermo, Italy.
>
> For many years Elektron's instruments have been a cornerstone of my live
> performances. A big part of my artistic search is bringing my compositions to
> the stage while always leaving the door open to improvisation. The central
> challenge in that search has always been striking the right balance between
> automation and hands-on control. Too much automation makes things rigid and
> takes away the freedom to step off the script. At the same time, getting
> consistent results — in performance and in sound — demands a setup that is
> reliable and predictable, something a purely hardware rig makes genuinely
> difficult.
>
> On that front Elektron hardware offers exceptional reliability and sound
> quality — qualities recognized the world over, and the reason each of their
> machines has been so successful. And yet the Octatrack is now more than 16
> years old, and while its firmware has been updated several times, the way it
> *works for live performance* hasn't evolved substantially. Elektron's
> developers must surely feel swamped by all the feature requests from their
> users, and it must be hard to decide where to invest the team's precious time
> to deliver the most value.
>
> That's why I started this project: to open up the possibility of experimenting
> with changes and small modifications that make my artistic search easier — and
> at the same time to feed my passion for the hardware and my hunger to learn
> from the best. In other words, **for strictly educational purposes.** I hope it
> proves useful to other artists on a similar search.

## ⚠️ Warning — read before doing anything

**This project is strictly for personal use, and I honestly do not recommend
updating the firmware of any Elektron unit with anything other than official
firmware.** It is a risky operation: it puts the product warranty in question and
it can leave the unit unusable.

Nothing in this repository is endorsed by, supported by, or affiliated with
Elektron. If you flash a modified OS you do so entirely at your own risk. The
study of the firmware (static analysis) is harmless; *writing* a non-official OS
to real hardware is not. If in doubt, don't flash — just read, disassemble, and
learn.

---

## What has been investigated

Everything below was verified against the official **OS 1.40C for Octatrack
MKII** — either from the firmware's own checksums, byte-exact decompilation, or
direct disassembly. Full write-ups live in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)
(consolidated architecture) and [`NOTES.md`](NOTES.md) (chronological log).

### Hardware
- **CPU:** Freescale/NXP **ColdFire** (likely MCF5445x, 32-bit, big-endian,
  ~266 MHz) — a 68000-family core, *not* ARM. The firmware corroborates it: it
  drives the on-chip ATA controller in the MBAR region (`0xFC04_51xx`) that
  characterizes the MCF5445x.
- **Audio DSP:** Freescale **DSP56xxx**, confirmed by the 24-bit word size used
  when the boot loader uploads the DSP program 3 bytes at a time.
- **Storage:** **CompactFlash** (FAT16/32) over the ColdFire's on-chip ATA
  controller, reached through the FlexBus.

### Firmware format and update chain
Elektron ships a ZIP with **two transports of the same OS** — a `.bin` and a
`.syx` — both wrapping the same compressed container:

```
.bin  = [ELUP hdr][seed] + XOR-feedback( [len] + ELEK( aPLib( MAIN OS ) ) ) + checksum
.syx  = SysEx 7-bit(              ELEK( aPLib( MAIN OS ) )              )
```

- **ELUP layer** (`.bin` only): XOR obfuscation with feedback plus an additive
  checksum. Reimplemented in `tools/make_bin.py` / `tools/bin_decode.py` and
  validated by regenerating Elektron's own official `.bin` byte-for-byte.
- **ELEK layer:** a proprietary container whose payload is compressed with
  **aPLib**; it decompresses to the **MAIN OS** (1,112,560 bytes, loaded at base
  `0x40000400`).
- **No cryptographic signature** on any layer — the OS is analyzable and, with
  recalculated checksums, rebuildable. That's *why* the format can be repacked at
  all; it is not a security bypass.
- The updater validates the OS (`FUN_4007f748`) with explicit error codes:
  `-2` not a valid OS · `-3` length · `-4` checksum · `-5` MK1 not allowed ·
  `-6` no downgrade.

### Operating system
- A **proprietary preemptive microkernel** (not MQX/ThreadX/VxWorks — banner
  `ElektronOctatrack DPS-1`). Task Control Blocks, per-priority ready queues,
  context switch via `TRAP #0`, blocking message queues, and a time slice driven
  by the ColdFire PIT timer (`0xFC08_0000`).
- The same message-queue pattern unifies the whole firmware: the ATA "async
  queues" and the audio "voice mailboxes" *are* kernel message queues.

### Audio engine and sequencer
- 8 track voices in the `0x80000000` shared-RAM window (base `0x800049d8`,
  stride `0xA8`).
- Control path: a sequencer trig writes a voice mailbox → a control-rate frame
  builder assembles a parameter frame into a **double buffer** → handshake to the
  **DSP56xxx** over MMIO at `0x20000000`, which does the real-time synthesis.
- Work split: **ColdFire = control** (RTOS, sequencer, parameter assembly);
  **DSP = signal** (playback, time-stretch, filters, FX).

### Practical outcome — the optional patches
As a demonstration of the above, OCTAMAX can build an image with a few behavior
changes, **all OFF by default** and toggled from the **PERSONALIZE** menu, so a
freshly flashed unit is indistinguishable from stock until you opt in:

| feature | effect |
|---|---|
| **Lazy transitions** | On a pattern change to a different Part, sounding tracks keep the previous Part's sound (no volume jump). The track LED dims while the track hasn't been re-trigged since the change; a trig commits it to the destination Part. Also keeps the A/B scene pointers on the same slots across the change. |
| **No BANK/PTN countdown** | The SELECT BANK / SELECT PATTERN windows stop expiring after four seconds. |
| **Arp key scales** | The MIDI arpeggiator's key-scale (ARP SETUP, F knob) gains 10 extra qualities beyond the stock major/minor: the five Greek modes (Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Locrian) plus blues, phrygian-dominant, melodic-minor, octatonic and hirajoshi — 12 qualities × 12 roots. `OFF`/`maj`/`min` stay byte-identical to stock, so the extra scales only appear if you scroll the F knob past them. |
| **PERSONALIZE options** | The two behavior switches (lazy transitions, no countdown), added to the PERSONALIZE menu, unchecked by default. |
| **Boot branding** | Boot splash and SYSTEM STATUS show `MAXOLYDIAN` instead of `1.40C`. |

The code changes live in a free code cave and are reached by 6-byte jump detours.
The arp-scales work is written up in [`NOTES.md`](NOTES.md) (search "ARP key-scale");
the behavior patches have a per-hunk table in [`sysex/README.md`](sysex/README.md).

## Building a `.syx` or `.bin` from scratch

You need your own copy of the official OS. The build is fully reproducible: given
the same stock file it emits a `.syx` byte-identical to the reference build.

### 0. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **A cross-assembler for the ColdFire** (only needed to rebuild the stubs from
  source): `m68k-elf-as`, `m68k-elf-ld`, `m68k-elf-objcopy` (targeting
  `-mcpu=5407`).
- **`elektron-firmware-tool`** — cloned and built by `setup.sh` into `vendor/`.
  It's patched locally (see `tools/elektron-firmware-tool.patch`) so it can write
  the full 10-character version field and emit the rebuilt container.

```sh
./fetch-os.sh     # downloads the official OS 1.40C into downloads/ and extracts it
./setup.sh        # clones + patches + builds elektron-firmware-tool into vendor/
```

### 1. The fast path — apply the pre-built patch

The 1,175 bytes of ColdFire code are already assembled and captured, hunk by
hunk, in `sysex/patches/maxolydian-r10.json` (each hunk carries its load address,
the original bytes it expects, and the replacement bytes). To produce a `.syx`:

```sh
python3 sysex/apply_patch.py \
    -i downloads/extracted/OCTATRACK_OS1.40C.syx \
    -o OCTATRACK_MAXOLYDIAN.syx
```

```
[1/5] stock .syx checksum ok
[2/5] extracted section_3_MAIN_OS.bin (1,112,560 bytes)
[3/5] applied 22 hunks (1175 bytes)
[4/5] repacked -> OCTATRACK_MAXOLYDIAN.syx
[5/5] output checksum ok — byte-identical to the reference build
```

The script **aborts before writing anything** if the stock checksum is wrong, if
the original bytes under any hunk don't match (wrong firmware, or already
patched), or if the patched image's checksum is off.

### 2. The full path — rebuild the stubs from source

If you want to change the behavior (or just verify the JSON), rebuild the patched
MAIN OS from the assembly sources. `tools/build.py` assembles every stub
(`tools/patch*.s`), places them in the free code cave, and derives **every**
detour target from the linker's symbol table (never hardcoded — a stale detour
once froze the unit on the logo screen), verifying the original bytes at each
site first:

```sh
python3 tools/build.py            # assembles the stubs -> out/mainos.bin
```

Then wrap `out/mainos.bin` back into a transport with the patched
`elektron-firmware-tool`. Section 3 is the MAIN OS; `-V MAXOLYDIAN` sets the
10-character version field:

```sh
# -> .syx (for MIDI upgrade, or the reference artifact)
vendor/elektron-firmware-tool/elektron-firmware-tool \
    -i downloads/extracted/OCTATRACK_OS1.40C.syx \
    -c 3 out/mainos.bin -V MAXOLYDIAN \
    -o OCTATRACK_MAXOLYDIAN.syx
```

### 3. Making a `.bin` for the CF-card OS UPGRADE

The `.bin` transport (flashed from the CF card via **PROJECT → OS UPGRADE**) is
much faster than trickling the `.syx` over MIDI at 31250 baud. `tools/make_bin.py`
wraps the ELEK container into an ELUP `.bin`. Its correctness is not assumed — it
regenerates Elektron's own official `.bin` byte-for-byte before writing yours:

```sh
# dump the rebuilt ELEK container, then wrap it as an ELUP .bin
EFT_EMIT_CONTAINER=elek.bin vendor/elektron-firmware-tool/elektron-firmware-tool \
    -i downloads/extracted/OCTATRACK_OS1.40C.syx \
    -c 3 out/mainos.bin -V MAXOLYDIAN -o OCTATRACK_MAXOLYDIAN.syx

python3 tools/make_bin.py elek.bin -o OCTATRACK_MAXOLYDIAN.bin
```

### 4. Flashing

**Read [`FLASHING.md`](FLASHING.md) first** — it covers the recovery net in
detail. In short:

- The upgrade goes over **MIDI DIN, not USB** (the `.syx` path), or from the
  **CF card** (the `.bin` path, faster).
- Keep the **official `.syx`** at hand. `[FUNC]` + power on → `[TRIG 3]`
  (MIDI UPGRADE) recovers the unit even if the OS is corrupt — the bootloader is
  never touched by an OS update, which is why a brick here is soft and
  recoverable.
- Never cut power during **`UPDATING FLASH`**.
- Your CF card, projects and samples are not affected by an OS update.
- An OS upgrade **resets the PERSONALIZE settings**, so the unit comes back stock
  (all features off) until you re-enable them.

## Legality (not legal advice)

- Static analysis of the publicly distributed OS carries **zero risk to the
  hardware** and is the whole point of this project.
- EU: Directive 2009/24/EC Art. 5 (observe/study/test a program you lawfully use)
  and Art. 6 (decompilation for interoperability). Elektron's EULA may contain
  anti-RE clauses — a contractual matter separate from copyright.
- Private and educational use is low-risk. Redistributing modified binaries is a
  different question; this repo deliberately redistributes **no** Elektron
  binary.
